Some features python do not have:-

--> "--" (decrement) & "++" (increment) operators
--> "do-while" loop


--> variables and methods declared in loops and conditionals are not block scoped and can be accessed outside, but it is only possible we are successfully entering that condition
--> functions are not block scoped
