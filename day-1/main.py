'''

--> input() function is used to display a prompt and take user input in that function

--> indentation should always start from left most

--> input function always takes input as a string

--> int() & str() is used to convert into integer and string respectively

--> len() function is used to calculate length of a string, doesn't work on string

--> In python, snake case is preferred

--> "\n" is used for new line

--> In print statement, either alternate " " & ' ' is used or use \' \' (backslash)

--> In python, type coercion does not happen. Thus, even this concatenation --> print("a: " * 2) --> is invalid
